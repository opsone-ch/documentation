Access with SSH
---------------

On the server you can work with SSH.
Due to security reasons, we allow key based logins only.

1. If you don't have an SSH key: `Create an SSH key pair <../howto/sshkey.html>`_
2. Add your SSH Public Key in the Cockpit: Either for the whole server or within the website.
3. Now you can log in via SSH. Username is your chosen website name.

.. tip:: Wondering why your existing SSH key is not working? Maybe it does not meet our `minimum requirements <../howto/sshkey.html>`__.
