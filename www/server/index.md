# Server

## Create/Modify

By now, there are still some manual steps required to install a new server. Therefore, you have to order them manually through our team. We are working hard to finish our API where those manual steps are not required anymore.

In the meantime, we will receive orders for new servers by [E-Mail](mailto:support@snowflake.ch?subject=Order Server). Please submit the following informations:

- billing contact
- technical contact, if applicable
- desired hostname (customer01.snowflakehosting.ch)
- size (CPU, Memory, Diskspace)


## Infrastructure

We run our own private cloud in Switzerland, where we are located in two different datacenters. Those datacenters are equipped with state of the art technology like dual power/cooling systems, USV/diesel generators and so on. Our two locations are connected by DWDM to each other. You will find more marketing and contract related details on our [website](https://snowflake.ch/hosting/).

As RIPE LIR, we got our own autonomous system ([AS198249](http://bgp.he.net/AS198249)) which is connected trough multiple, redundant transit providers. Furthermore, we are connected to the [Swiss Internet Exchange](http://www.swissix.ch/) where we established peerings to a lot of other providers such as Swisscom, Hurricane Electric, GGA Maur, WWZ, Ticinocom, Leunet, BIT and many more. We believe in a open internet and therefore enforce a open peering policy.

Our private cloud is fully virtualised, based ond the KVM hypervisor. We use the [Nutanix virtual computing](http://www.nutanix.com/) platform for the server and the storage tier in a single, integrated appliance. Nutanix uses the same web-scale principles and technologies that power the IT environment at innovative web companies and cloud providers such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon.
