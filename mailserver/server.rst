Server
======

We offer our mailserver based on Postfix, Dovecot, and rspamd.
As webmail we offer Roundcube or SOGo Groupware.
Each server is dedicated to a certain customer,
therefore you can add any number of domains and accounts limited only by the ressources available (CPU/RAM/Diskspace).

.. note:: We recommend that you use a dedicated domain for your mailserver installation

Maintenance

Maintenance is announced on `opsstatus.ch <https://opsstatus.ch/>`__ and carried out at night whenever possible.

Monitoring
----------

Our mailservers are monitored 24x7. We make sure that all services are up and running
and also check email delivery to some common targets.

* Email delivery to well-known services such as Google Mail, GMX, Hotmail and Bluewin.
* Services such as SMTP, POP, Webmail, WebDAV and CallDAV.
* Monitoring of several DNS-based Blackhole Lists.
* And many other checks to ensure a smooth operation.
