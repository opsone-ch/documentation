Caching
=======

Install and manage different caching applications. By now, the following
backends are supported:

-  memcached
-  Varnish

memcached
---------

To install memcached, add ``memcached`` to the ``caching::backend``
hash.

Memory Ratio
~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, a ``memory_ratio`` of 8 is used, which means memcached will
take up to 1/8 of this servers total memory.

address
~~~~~~~

By default, memcached will listen on the localhost interface. If memcached has to
bind to another address, use the ``address`` parameter to specify it.

port
~~~~

By default, memcached will listen on port 11211. If memcached has to bind to
another port, use the ``port`` parameter to specify it.

Full example
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "caching::backend": {
      "memcached": {
        "ensure": "present",
        "memory_ratio": "8",
        "address": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": "11211"
      }
    }
  }

Varnish
-------

To install Varnish, add ``varnish`` to the ``caching::backend`` hash.

address/address6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, Varnish will listen on the eth1 interface. If Varnish has to
bind to other addresses, use the ``address`` and ``address6`` parameter
to specify them.

port/port6
~~~~~~~~~~

By default, Varnish will listen on port 80. If Varnish has to bind to
another port, use the ``port`` and ``port6`` parameter to specify them.

vcl\_type
~~~~~~~~~

With ``vcl_type``, you choose a tempalte which is used by Varnish as
default VCL configuration. By now, the following types are available:

-  ``default``: Varnish default configuration which does not very much
   but is perfetly suitable for your own, custom configuration trough
   ``vcl_include``
-  ``typo3``: Varnish configuration for the ``varnish`` TYPO3 extension

vcl\_include
~~~~~~~~~~~~

With ``vcl_include``, you can define a full path to a additional
configuration file. This file gets included into the Varnish default
configuration.

.. hint:: keep in mind to issue a ``puppet-agent`` run after changing the local Varnish configuration. Puppet will copy your local configuration file to a global location and ensure that Varnish is able to read it

Memory Ratio
~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, a ``memory_ratio`` of 2 is used, which means Varnish will
take up to 50% of this servers total memory.

daemon_options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add one or more startup options to the Varnish daemon with ``daemon_options``.

.. warning:: changing this value can led to unintended consequences. Please make sure to plan any changes carefully and ask us for advice if you're in doubt

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "caching::backend": {
      "varnish": {
        "ensure": "present",
        "address": "185.17.68.153",
        "port": "80",
        "address6": "2a04:503:0:1003::153",
        "port6": "80",
        "vcl_type": "default",
        "vcl_include": "/home/user/cnf/varnish.vcl",
        "memory_ratio": "4"
      }
    },
    "caching::wrapper::varnish::daemon_options": "-p vcc_allow_inline_c=on"
  }
