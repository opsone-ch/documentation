Database Service
================

Install and manage your favorite databases. Including users, grants, and
the configuration.

MySQL / MariaDB
---------------

Instead of MySQL, we use MariaDB, which is a drop-in replacement with
API/ABI compatibility to MySQL.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You have to set mysql::server::root\_password manually.

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "mysql::server::root_password": "password"
  }

.. hint:: Min-Length: 8, Max-Length: 32, A-Za-z0-9 only

Databases
~~~~~~~~~

-  add a Database
-  title: Database Name
-  type: Database Type: "mysql"
-  user\_password: adds a User with the same Name as the Database with
   this Password and grant all privileges

   -  without this, you have to add user/grants by yourself (see below),
      otherwise only root can access this database
   -  it is only possible to add a local User here. For special
      Configurations (e.g. external access or grants to particular
      Tables use users/grants below)

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "database::databases": {
      "<database-name-without-user>": {
        "type": "mysql"
      },
      "<database-name-with-user>": {
        "type": "mysql",
        "user_password": "<cleartext-password>"
      }
    }
  }

Users
~~~~~

-  add a User
-  you have to add desired grants additionally
-  if you add Users for remote Hosts, also add corresponding Firewall
   Rule

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "database::users": {
      "<username>@localhost": {
        "password": "<cleartext-password>"
      },
      "<username>@<remote-hostname>": {
        "password": "<cleartext-password>"
      }
    }
  }

Grants
~~~~~~

-  grant Access for a User to a Database and Tables

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "database::grants": {
      "<username>@localhost": {
        "user": "<username>@localhost",
        "database": "<database-name>",
        "table": "*"
      },
      "<username>@<remote-hostname>": {
        "user": "<username>@<remote-hostname>",
        "database": "<database-name>",
        "table": "*"
      },
      "<username-for-specific-table>@<remote-hostname>": {
        "user": "<username-for-specific-table>@<remote-hostname>",
        "database": "<database-name>",
        "table": "<specific-table-name>"
      },
      "<username-for-specific-table-with-privileges>@<remote-hostname>": {
        "user": "<username-for-specific-table>@<remote-hostname>",
        "database": "<database-name>",
        "table": "<specific-table-name>",
        "privileges": [
          "SELECT",
          "INSERT"
        ]
      }
    }
  }

Additional configuration options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``mysql::server::root_password``: Password for the root User
-  ``mysql::server::ft_min_word_len``: Value for the ft\_min\_word\_len
   option

Backup
~~~~~~

Every database is backed up daily into the users backup directory:

::

    /home/userdir/backup/

Restore
^^^^^^^

Choose between 2 options.

1. "rollback" with the MySQL binlog (point in time recovery)
2. restore the nightly backup

Rollback
''''''''

Import the binlog.

-  start-datetime: time of the last nightly dump
-  stop-datetime: required restore point

and rollback:

::

    mysqlbinlog --start-datetime="2015-02-09 22:07:00" --stop-datetime="2015-02-10 17:15:00" /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.* | mysql database

Nightly restore
'''''''''''''''

for a complete restore of the nightly database backup, decompress the
backup, import it and remove the .sql file:

::

    cd ~/backup/ && lzop -d database.sql.lzo && mysql database < database.sql && rm database.sql

the database.sql.lzo.1 is the backup from yesterday.

Access
~~~~~~

phpmyadmin
^^^^^^^^^^

We provide a central `phpMyAdmin
installation <https://dbadmin.opsone.ch>`__ to access your
database. Use the following settings to connect:

-  Server: database hostname, e.g. customer01.snowflakehosting.ch
-  Username: see DB\_USERNAME in ``~/.profile``
-  Password: see DB\_PASSWORD in ``~/.profile``

SSH tunnel
^^^^^^^^^^

To access the database with common database tools like MySQL Workbench,
create a SSH tunnel to the server and forward the MySQL port. After
that, configure your favorite MySQL tool to connect to the forwarded
localhost.

::

    ssh -L 3306:localhost:3306 user@remotehost

Or directly with every ssh connection to the server with the following
ssh .config entry:

::

    LocalForward 3306 127.0.0.1:3306

local
^^^^^

simply access your database over the shell:

::

    mysql

Postgresql
----------

Databases
~~~~~~~~~

-  add a Database
-  title: Database Name
-  type: Database Type: "postgresql"
-  user\_password: adds a User with the same Name as the Database with
   this Password and grant all privileges

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "database::databases": {
      "withuser": {
        "type": "postgresql",
        "user_password": "cleartext-password"
      }
    }
  }

Backup
~~~~~~

Every database is dumped daily into the ``~/backup/`` directory.

Elasticsearch
-------------

You can setup an Elasticsearch instance as simple as any database.

Settings
~~~~~~~~

The Elasticsearch Database Type accepts the following settings: \*
``memory_ratio`` - will set the memory available to elasticsearch (see
server/configuration for details) \* ``custom_conf`` - array that will
be appended to the elasticsearch config file (see example below) Note:
Don't overwrite ``path.repo`` here unless you know what you're doing.
Backup will probably fail.

Access
~~~~~~

Elasticsearch only locally accessible through localhost:9200. You can
setup a Proxy as follows:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "websites::site": {
      "elasticproxy": {
        "server_name": "elastic.host",
        "type": "proxy",
        "members": [
          "localhost:9200"
        ]
      }
    }
  }

Protection
~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to protect your instance, you can do so on the proxy set
above. If you put following example in your ``~cnf/nginx.conf``, you can
only write to elasticsearch from the ip/netmask set and will have naxsi
activated for all requests.

::

    location ~ /.* {
        limit_except GET {
            allow 154.132.02.15;
            deny all;
        }

        include /etc/nginx/naxsi/naxsi.rules;
        include /home/elastic/cnf/nginx_waf.conf;

        proxy_pass          http://elasticproxy;
        proxy_read_timeout  90;
        proxy_connect_timeout  90;
        proxy_redirect  default;
        proxy_set_header        Host $host;
        proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

    }

Example
~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "database::databases": {
      "elastic": {
        "type": "elasticsearch",
        "memory_ratio": "1.5",
        "custom_conf": [
          "node.name: my_elastic_node_004",
          "discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes: 2"
        ]
      }
    }
  }

Backup
~~~~~~

Elasticsearch is backed up using the Snapshot-Feature: Every night, the
server takes a new snapshot backs this snapshot away. This way, you can
restore the indexes on a nightly basis. If you need to restore the data
of the past night, you can simple do this via the Rest API using the
``backup`` snapshot.

Note: Of course you can define other snapshots and backup manually more
often or keep them further back. Use ``custom_conf`` for configuring a
new snapshot-folder (make sure the user ``elasticsearch`` can write
there) and the rest of the setup is possible via Rest API.
