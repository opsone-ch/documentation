   :name: varnish

=======
Varnish
=======

Varnish is fully configured through the `Custom JSON` :ref:`customjson_server`.

Enable
======

To install Varnish, set ``varnish::ensure`` to `present`.

address/address6
================

By default, Varnish will listen on the localhost interface. If Varnish has to
bind to other addresses, use the ``address`` and ``address6`` parameter
to specify them.

port/port6
==========

By default, Varnish will listen on port 8022. If Varnish has to bind to
another port, use the ``port`` and ``port6`` parameter to specify them.

vcl\_type
=========

With ``vcl_type``, you choose a tempalte which is used by Varnish as
default VCL configuration. By now, the following types are available:

* ``default``: Varnish default configuration which does not very much
  but is perfetly suitable for your own, custom configuration trough
  ``vcl_include``
* ``typo3``: Varnish configuration for the ``varnish`` TYPO3 extension
  (see
  `GitLab <https://gitlab.com/opsone_ch/typo3/varnish/=/blob/master/Resources/Private/Example/default.vcl>`__)

vcl\_include
============

By default, Varnish uses HTTP headers to decide whether a request should be cached or not.
See the chapter `The role of HTTP Headers <https://varnish-cache.org/docs/6.1/users-guide/increasing-your-hitrate.html#the-role-of-http-headers>`_ in the official Varnish documentation.

With ``vcl_include``, you can define a full path to a additional
configuration file. This file gets included into the Varnish default
configuration.

.. tip::

   Keep in mind to issue a ``puppet-agent`` run after changing the local
   Varnish configuration. Puppet will copy your local configuration file
   to a global location and ensure that Varnish is able to read it.

Memory Ratio
============

By default, a ``memory_ratio`` of 2 is used, which means Varnish will
take up to 50% of this servers total memory.

daemon_options
==============

Add one or more startup options to the Varnish daemon with ``daemon_options``.
