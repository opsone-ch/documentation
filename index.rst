Managed Server Version 5
========================

You are looking at the documentation of our managed server version 5.
Switch to the documentation for other versions by using the versions selector below.

We are using so called server generations,
based on a certain Debian release and tied to versions of further software like PHP, MySQL and so on.
This concept allows you to select the appropriate version depending on the application you use,
and also to switch to a newer generation in a planned way according to your needs.
