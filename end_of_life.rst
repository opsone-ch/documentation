End-of-Life (EOL)
=================

Generally speaking, an End-of-Life product (EOL product) is a product at the end of the lifecycle which prevents users from receiving updates, indicating that the product is at the end of its useful life. Users can continue to access discontinued products, but cannot receive security updates and technical support.

End-of-Life of Managed Servers
------------------------------

End-of-Life dates of our Managed Servers reflect the release cycles of Debian and its End-of-Life dates. The respective End-of-Life date of a server is visible in the cockpit at any time during creation and operation.

The following disadvantages occur when continuing to operate the managed server after the End-of-Life date:

* No more adjustments will be made to the servers
* Possible security gaps cannot be closed
* External dependencies are not updated

The responsibility for the change to a new server version lies with the customer. Automatic in-place updates are not provided. Ops One refrains from deactivating servers with End-of-Life and leaves it up to the customer to decide how long the server should continue to operate.

Availability and Liability
--------------------------

For Managed Servers that are End-of-Life, Ops One can therefore no longer guarantee availability. In addition, liability for these servers is declined.
